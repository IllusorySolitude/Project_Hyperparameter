Title: An Empirical Study on Hyperparameters for Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Techniques

Abstract: 	Social networking services became an integral part of our society's existence. The amount of data that's being generated everyday contains every bit of our lives. In this context, sentiment analysis plays a key role in various different industries in order to grasp people's opinions and emotions on a person or an entity through text or through visual data. This report conducted an empiric study on hyperparameters for twitter sentiment analysis using machine learning algorithms and deep learning. We developed a detailed methodology in order to train models or predict sentiments. Then, we did a hyperparameter tuning on these algorithms in order to improve the accuracy followed by a discussion of these results. On one hand, we tested various algorithms for machine learning but decided on logistic regression, random forest and support vector machines (SVM) using hyperparameters C for the first two and n$\_$estimators for the last to optimize the algorithms. On the other hand, we used Bidirectional long-short term memory (BiLSTM) neural network and hyperparameter T (Temperature) in the Softmax layer to optimize our model. This report discussed in detail all the above mentioned topics and provided a methodology for twitter sentiment analysis along with hyperparameter tuning.
